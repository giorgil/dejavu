<h2>Application Designers: Using Dejavu to Construct a Domain Model</h2>

<a name='units'><h3>Units</h3></a>
<p>When constructing a Domain Model for your application, you will want
to distinguish between objects that will be persisted and objects that
will not. By registering a subclass of <tt>dejavu.Unit</tt>, you allow
instances of that subclass to be persisted.</p>

<p>Before you can register your Unit class, you must create it:
<pre>import dejavu
class Printer(dejavu.Unit): pass</pre>
This is all you need for a fully-functioning Unit class. There are
no methods or attributes that you are required to override; simply
subclass from <tt>Unit</tt>. However, this is a fairly uninteresting
class. It automatically has an ID property, but doesn't provide any
functionality other than what <tt>Unit</tt> already provides. The first
thing we will probably want to add to our new class is persistent data.</p>

<h4>UnitProperty</h4>
<p>Once you have defined a persistent class (by subclassing <tt>Unit</tt>),
you need to make another decision. Rather than persist the entire object
<tt>__dict__</tt>, you specify a subset of persistent attributes by using
<tt>UnitProperty</tt>, a data descriptor. If you've used Python's builtin
property() construct, you've used descriptors before.</p>

<p>We might enhance our Printer example thusly:
<pre>from dejavu import Unit, UnitProperty
class Printer(Unit):
    Manufacturer = UnitProperty(unicode)
    ColorCopies = UnitProperty(bool)
    PPM = UnitProperty(float)</pre>
This adds three persistent attributes to our <tt>Printer</tt> objects,
each with a different datatype. In addition, every subclass of <tt>Unit</tt>
inherits an 'ID' property, an int.</p>

<p>When you get and set <tt>UnitProperty</tt> attributes, they behave just
like any other attributes:
<pre>>>> p = Printer()
>>> p.PPM = 25
>>> p.PPM
25.0</pre>
However, you will notice right away that the int value we provided has been
coerced to a float behind the scenes. This is because we specified the PPM
attribute as a 'float' type when we created it. The value of a Unit
Property is restricted to the type which you specify. The only other valid
value for a Unit Property is None; any Property may be None at any time,
and in fact, all Properties are None until you assign values to them:
<pre>>>> p.ColorCopies is None
True</pre></p>

<a name='unitproperty_types'><h5>UnitProperty types</h5></a>
<p>Dejavu is extensible, and in official specification/API terms, any Python
type is allowed as a <tt>UnitProperty.type</tt>. The standard distribution
tends to provide full support for:

<ul>
    <li><tt>bool</tt></li>
    <li><tt>int</tt></li>
    <li><tt>long</tt></li>
    <li><tt>float</tt></li>
    <li><tt>decimal.Decimal</tt></li>
    <li><tt>fixedpoint.FixedPoint</tt></li>
    <li><tt>str</tt></li>
    <li><tt>unicode</tt></li>
    <li><tt>datetime.date</tt></li>
    <li><tt>datetime.time</tt></li>
    <li><tt>datetime.datetime</tt></li>
    <li><tt>datetime.timedelta</tt></li>
    <li><tt>tuple</tt></li>
    <li><tt>list</tt></li>
    <li><tt>dict</tt></li>
</ul>

...where "full support" means that all StorageManagers distributed with
Dejavu MUST correctly store these types and SHOULD optimize their storage
as well as they can. In many cases, the complex types (tuple, list, dict)
are pickled, and indeed any other type that is not represented here tends
to be pickled. It's important to realize, however, that different storage
managers have complete latitude to optimize as they see fit; for example,
the RamStorage class stores values whole, doesn't need to serialize, and
therefore does no pickling at all.</p>

<h5>datetime.datetime</h5>
<p>If you use <tt>datetime.datetime</tt> for the type of a UnitProperty,
most StorageManagers will throw away the microseconds. This is an
unfortunate oversight that should be corrected sometime in the future.</p>

<h4>Unit ID's</h4>
<p>All Units possess an <tt>identifiers</tt> attribute, a tuple of
their UnitProperty names which define the uniqueness of a Unit. The
<tt>Unit</tt> base class possesses a single Unit Property, an int
named 'ID', and its <tt>identifiers</tt> attribute is therefore
<tt>('ID',)</tt>. That's a string in the tuple; older versions of Dejavu
used a reference to the actual UnitProperty class instead. If you wish
to use identifiers
of a different number, types, or names, simply replace the
<tt>identifiers</tt> attribute in your subclass:</p>

<pre>class Printer(Unit):
    # Set ID to None to remove the ID property from this subclass.
    ID = None
    
    Model = UnitProperty(unicode)
    UnitNumber = UnitProperty(int)
    identifiers = ('Model', 'UnitNumber')
</pre>

<p>Every Unit should possess at least one identifier. This ensures that
each Unit within the system is unique. You should consider any
UnitProperty which is one of the identifiers to be read-only
after a Unit has been memorized. Extremely rare applications
(like write-only log tables) are allowed to use en empty identifiers
tuple, but in most OLTP/OLAP scenarios, all your Units should
have at least one identifier property.</p>

<h4>Creating and Populating Properties</h4>
<p>In addition to defining Unit Properties within your class body,
you can define them after the class body has been executed via
the classmethod <tt class='def'>Unit.set_property()</tt>. For example,
the following two classes are equivalent:
<pre>class Book(Unit):
    Content = UnitProperty(unicode)

class Book(Unit): pass
Book.set_property('Content', unicode)</pre>

Declarations outside of the class body allow more dynamic setting of
Unit properties. You can define multiple properties at once via
the <tt class='def'>Unit.set_properties()</tt> classmethod:

<pre>class Book(Unit): pass
Book.set_properties({'Content': unicode,
                     'Publisher': unicode,
                     'Year': int,
                     })</pre>
</p>

<p>You also have options when populating Unit Properties. The standard way
is simply to reference them as normal Python instance attributes. However,
you may also use the <tt class='def'>adjust()</tt> method to modify
multiple properties at once; pass in keyword arguments which match the
properties you wish to modify. Keyword arguments also work when
instantiating the object. For example, the following three code
snippets are equivalent:

<pre>pub = Book()
pub.Publisher = 'Walter J. Black'
pub.Year = 1928

pub = Book()
pub.adjust(Publisher='Walter J. Black', Year=1928)

pub = Book(Publisher='Walter J. Black', Year=1928)</pre>
</p>

<h4>Unit Properties are First-Class Objects</h4>
<p>Like many descriptors, Unit Properties behave differently when you access
them from the class, rather than from an instance as above. When calling
them from the class, you receive the <tt>UnitProperty</tt> object itself,
rather than its value for a given instance. That is,
<pre>>>> c = Printer.ColorCopies
>>> c
&lt;dejavu.UnitProperty object at 0x01112970></pre>
This is significant, because it allows us to store metadata about the
property itself:
<pre>>>> c.type, c.index, c.hints, c.key
(&lt;type 'bool'>, False, {}, 'ColorCopies')</pre>

When you define a UnitProperty instance, you can pass in these extra
attributes. Its signature is <tt class='def'>UnitProperty(type=unicode,
index=False, hints={}, key=None, default=None)</tt>. Supply any, all,
or none of them as
needed. The <tt>key</tt> attribute is merely the property's canonical name,
and is usually set for you. The <tt>index</tt> value tells database Storage
Managers whether or not to index the column (if they do any indexing). The
<tt>type</tt> attribute limits property values to instances of that type
(or <tt>None</tt>). Finally, the <tt>hints</tt> dictionary provides hints
to Storage Managers to help optimize storage. If you write a custom Storage
Manager, you may define and use your own hints. Here are the ones that most
builtin SM's understand:</p>

<table>
<tr><th>Key</th><th>Values</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr>
    <td>bytes</td>
    <td>b &gt;= 0</td>
    <td>Inform SMs that a particular property will never exceed <i>b</i>
        bytes. This applies to <tt>long</tt> and <tt>int</tt> properties,
        as well as <tt>str</tt> and <tt>unicode</tt>. A value of 0 implies
        no limit. If not specified, a default maximum will be used. Many
        database backends default to 255; non-database backends often have
        no limit. Check your Storage Manager.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>scale</td>
    <td>s &gt;= 0</td>
    <td>Scale is the number of digits to the right of the decimal point
        in a NUMERIC (fixedpoint or decimal) field. This hint informs SMs
        that would usually store such data at a default scale (usually 2),
        that the property should use a different scale.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>precision</td>
    <td>p &gt;= 0</td>
    <td>Precision is the total number of <b>decimal</b> digits in a NUMERIC
        (<tt>fixedpoint</tt> or <tt>decimal</tt>) field, or the total
        number of <b>binary</b> digits in a <tt>float</tt> field.
        This hint informs SMs that the property will never exceed
        <i>p</i> digits. If missing, the StorageManager will supply a
        default maximum precision. For example, PostgreSQL can handle
        1000 decimal digits. If explicitly set to 0 (zero), the
        StorageManager will allow unlimited precision, if possible.
        Note that the <tt>fixedpoint</tt> module uses the word
        "precision" where we use the word "scale"; it actually has
        unlimited precision (as we use the word). The <tt>decimal</tt>
        module, in contrast, uses limited precision but no scale.</td>
</tr>
</table>


<h4>Triggers</h4>
<p>Triggers are behaviors which fire when the value of a Unit Property is
changed. You can override a UnitProperty's __set__ method to achieve this
in Dejavu. For example:
<pre>class DatedProperty(UnitProperty):
    def __set__(self, unit, value):
        UnitProperty.__set__(self, unit, value)
        unit.Date = datetime.date.today()
        parent = unit.Forum()
        if parent:
            parent.Date = unit.Date

class Topic(Unit):
    Date = UnitProperty(datetime.date)
    Content = DatedProperty()
    ForumID = UnitProperty(int)

class Forum(Unit):
    Date = UnitProperty(datetime.date)

Topic.many_to_one('ForumID', Forum, 'ID')</pre>
In this example, whenever topic.Content is set, the <tt>__set__</tt>
method will be called and the object's <tt>Date</tt> attribute will
be modified. Then, the Topic's parent Forum is looked up and <i>its</i>
<tt>Date</tt> is modified.</p>

<p>As with any trigger system, you need to be careful not to have triggers
called out of order. For example, if a user changes both the ForumID and
Content properties in a single operation (like a web page submit), the old
Forum will be incorrectly modified if the Content property is applied
first. I don't have any cool tools built into Dejavu to help you with
this, but I'm open to suggestions.</p>

<h5>TriggerProperty</h5>
<p>There is also a <tt class='def'>TriggerProperty</tt> class,
which overrides <tt>__set__</tt> for you. If the value in question
changes (and the unit has a sandbox), then the
<tt class='def'>on_set(unit, oldvalue)</tt> method will be called.
Override it in your subclass like this:
<pre>
class NoteContentProperty(TriggerProperty):
    
    def on_set(self, unit, oldvalue):
        unit.LastModified = datetime.date.today()
</pre>

Note that, if you need to know what the <i>new</i> value is, it's
already been set on the unit.</p>

<a name='registering'><h4>Registration of Unit Classes</h4></a>
<p>In addition to defining your Unit class, you must also register that
class with your application's <tt>StorageManager</tt>. Each class which
you want Dejavu to manage must be passed to
<tt class='def'>store.register(cls)</tt>.
If you create a module with multiple classes, you can register them all
at once with <tt class='def'>store.register_all(globals())</tt>. It will
grab any Unit subclasses out of your module's globals() (or any other
mapping you pass to <tt>register_all</tt>) and register them. It then
returns a list of the classes it found.</p>

<p>The register and register_all methods also register any Associations
you have defined between Units.</p>

<p>If you're using multiple StorageManagers in a network, you must
register classes for each of them. You can inspect which classes have
been registered to a given store via <tt class='def'>store.classes</tt>,
a set. You shouldn't manipulate this structure on your own; use
<tt>register</tt> or <tt>register_all</tt> instead.</p>

<p>Each <tt>StorageManager</tt> object also manages the associations
between Unit classes in its <tt class='def'>associations</tt> attribute,
which is a simple, unweighted, undirected graph. Whenever you register
a Unit class, the SM will add its associations to this graph. The only
other common operation is to call
<tt class='def'>associations.shortest_path(start, end)</tt>,
to retrieve the chain of associations between two Unit classes.</p>


<a name='synchronizing'><h4>Synchronizing the Model</h4></a>

<p>Any database code in a general-purpose programming language will
eventually have to come to terms with the gap between native code
types and native storage types. In most cases for us, this means
matching Python types (like int and datetime) to database types
(like INT8 and TEXT). Dejavu provides this layer for databases by
using a mapping layer between your model code (Unit classes) and
the underlying tables and columns. The implementation of that is
unimportant (and possibly storage-dependent), but Dejavu needs
to know the database types in effect in order to translate data safely.</p>

<p>When you start your application, you need to call
<tt class='def'>store.map_all(conflicts='error')</tt> <i>after</i>
you have registered all of your Unit classes (but before you attempt
to execute commands on them).</p>

<p>If your application has created all of its own tables using Dejavu,
then there is generally nothing to worry about in terms of the "type gap";
Dejavu will default to creating columns of the types it knows best,
and you may be able to set the store's <tt>auto_discover</tt> attribute
to <tt>False</tt> and reduce application start-up time (Dejavu will use
a mock mapping layer in this case, based on your model). But if you are
building a Dejavu interface onto an existing database, or if you
customize/optimize your database by hand, then you should leave
it set to <tt>True</tt> (the default) for safety's sake.</p>


<a name='associations'><h3>Associations between Unit Classes</h3></a>
<p>Once you've put together some Unit classes, chances are you're going to
want to associate them. Generally, this is accomplished by creating a
property in the Unit_B class which stores IDs of Unit_A objects (which
might be called <i>foreign keys</i> in a database context).
<pre>class Archaeologist(Unit):
    Height = UnitProperty(float)

class Biography(Unit):
    ArchID = UnitProperty(int)
    PubDate = UnitProperty(datetime.date)</pre>
In this example, each <tt>Biography</tt> object will have an <tt>ArchID</tt>
attribute, which will equal the <tt>ID</tt> of some <tt>Archaeologist</tt>.
In Dejavu terms, we say that there is a <i>near class</i> (with a <i>near
key</i>) and a <i>far class</i> (with a <i>far key</i>). Associations in
Dejavu are not one-way, so it doesn't matter which class you choose for the
"near" one and which for the "far" one.</p>

<p>You could stop at this point in your design, and simply remember what
these keys are and how they relate, and manipulate them accordingly. But
Dejavu allows you to explicitly declare these associations:
<pre>Archaeologist.one_to_many('ID', Biography, 'ArchID')</pre>
You pass in the the near key, the far class, and the far key.
There are similar methods for one_to_one and many_to_one. In addition,
there is a Unit.associate method which allows you to use your own
relationship objects.</p>

<p>What does an explicit association buy for you? First, you can
<a href='managing.html#joins'>join</a> Units without having to remember
which keys are related. Second, StorageManagers
discover associations and fill the <tt>store.associations</tt> registry, so
that smart consumer code (like <a href='managing.html#unitenginerules'>Unit
Engine Rules</a>) can automatically follow association paths for you.
Third, each Unit class has a private <tt>_associations</tt> attribute,
a <tt>dict</tt>. Each Unit involved in in the association gains an entry
in that dict: the key is the far class name,
and the value is a UnitAssociation instance, a non-data (method) descriptor,
with additional nearClass, nearKey, farClass, farKey, and to_many attributes.</p>

<h4><tt>Unit.add()</tt></h4>
<p>Once two classes have been associated, you attach Unit <i>instances</i>
to each other by equating their associated properties. That was a
mouthful. Here's an example:
<pre>>>> evbio = Biography()
>>> evbio.ArchID = Eversley.ID
</pre>
The two unit <i>instances</i> (evbio and Eversley) are now associated
(only their <i>classes</i> were before). Keep in mind that many Unit
instances need to be memorized in order to obtain an ID.</p>

<p>Rather than forcing you to remember all of the related classes and keys,
Dejavu Units all have an <tt>add</tt> method, which does the same thing:
<pre>>>> evbio = Biography()
>>> evbio.add(Eversley)
</pre>
The <tt>add</tt> method works in either direction, so you could just as
well write:
<pre>>>> evbio = Biography()
>>> Eversley.add(evbio)
</pre>
The <tt>add</tt> method will take any number of unit instances as
arguments, and add each one in turn. That is:
<pre>
>>> evbio1 = Biography()
>>> evbio2 = Biography()
>>> evbio3 = Biography()
>>> Eversley.add(evbio1, evbio2, evbio3)
</pre>
</p>

<h4>"Related units" methods</h4>
<p>To make querying easier, each of the two Unit classes involved in an
association will gain a new
"related units" method which simplifies looking up related instances
of the other class. The new method for Unit_B will have the name of Unit_A,
and vice-versa. In our example:
<pre>>>> Archaeologist.Biography
&lt;unbound method Archaeologist.related_units>

>>> Eversley = Archaeologist(Height=6.417)
>>> Eversley.Biography
&lt;bound method Archaeologist.related_units of &lt;__main__.Archaeologist
object at 0x011A1930>>

>>> bios = Eversley.Biography()
>>> bios
[&lt;arch.Biography object at 0x01158E10>,
 &lt;arch.Biography object at 0x0118B350>,
 &lt;arch.Biography object at 0x0118B170>]
>>> evbio1.Archaeologist()
&lt;__main__.Archaeologist object at 0x011A1930>
</pre>
We've only created three Biographies at this point, so we can print the list
easily. At the other extreme (when you have hundreds of Biographies to filter),
you can pass an optional <tt>Expression</tt> object or keyword arguments
to the "related units" method, just like you can with
<a href='managing.html#recall'><tt>recall</tt></a>.
When you do, the list of associated Units will be filtered accordingly.</p>

<p>Notice that, because our relationship is one-to-many, <b>the two
"related units" methods behave differently</b>. The "one"
(Archaeologist) which is retrieving the "many" (Biography) retrieves
a list. The "many" retrieving the "one" retrieves a single Unit.
When retrieving "to-one", the result will always be a single Unit
(or None if there is no matching Unit). When retrieving "to-many",
the result will always be a list, (it will be empty if there are
no matches).</p>

<p>Because the "related units" method names are formed automatically, you need
to <b>take care not to use the names of Unit classes for your Unit properties</b>.
In our example, we used "ArchID" for the name of our "foreign key". If we
had used "Archaeologist" instead, we would have had problems; when we
associated the classes, the <i>property</i> named "Archaeologist" would
have collided with the <i>"related units" method</i> named "Archaeologist".
Be careful when naming your properties, and plan for the future. The best
approach is probably to end your property name with "ID" every time.</p>

<p>Unlike some other ORM's, Dejavu doesn't cache far Units within the near
Unit. Each time you call the "related units" method, the data is recalled
from your Sandbox. It is quite probable that those far Units are still
sitting in memory in the Sandbox, but they're not going to persist in
the near Unit itself in any way.</p>

<p>Finally, some of you may want to override the default "related units"
methods. Feel free; <tt>Unit.associate</tt> takes two optional arguments,
which should be subclasses of the UnitAssociation descriptor. See the
source code for more information.</p>

<h4>Custom Unit Associations</h4>

<p>Sometimes you need an association between two classes that is more complicated.
For example, you might have an Archaeologist object and want to retrieve
just their <i>last</i> Biography. Here's an example of how to do this:
<pre>class LastBiographyAssociation(dejavu.UnitAssociation):
    """Unit Association to relate an Archaeologist to their last Biography."""
    
    to_many = False
    register = False
    
    def related(self, unit, expr=None, **kwargs):
        bios = unit.Biography(expr, order=["PubDate DESC"], **kwargs)
        try:
            return bios.next()
        except StopIteration:
            return None

descriptor = LastBiographyAssociation(u'ID', Biography, u'ID')
descriptor.nearClass = Archaeologist
Archaeologist._associations["Last Biography"] = descriptor</pre>

There are a couple of things to note, here. We are basically doing by
hand what the <tt>associate</tt> method does for you automatically, but
that method makes <i>two</i> associations (one in each direction), and
we're only making one. The <tt class='def'>related(unit, expr, **kw)</tt>
method is overridden to do the actual lookup of far units. Because the
<tt>to_many</tt> attribute is False, <tt>related</tt> returns a single
Unit, or None. Finally, the <tt>register</tt> attribute, when False,
keeps the store from registering this association in its graph
(see <a href='#registering'>Registration</a>, above).</p>

<a name='many-to-many'><h4>Many-to-many Associations</h4></a>

<p>Sometimes you need an association between two classes (or even the
same class) where "many" relate to "many". For example, an Author
might have pulished many books, which might each possess multiple authors.
There are several techniques to implement this; here we provide the simplest
one and leave the rest as an exercise (in Internet search) for the reader.</p>

<p>Lots of relational stores like databases and so on do not provide mechanisms
for many-to-many relationships; they only provide one-to-many (or many-to-one,
which is the same thing). The easiest way to do many-to-many is to add an
intermediate table to contain the association itself. In our example, we
might add a new Unit class to model the 'authorship' association:

<pre>class Authorship(Unit):
    AuthorID = UnitProperty(int)
    BookID = UnitProperty(int)
Author.one_to_many('ID', Authorship, 'AuthorID')
Book.one_to_many('ID', Authorship, 'BookID')
</pre></p>

<img src='many2many.gif' />

<p>A query for the titles of all books written by Sholem Aleichem might
look like this:

<pre>>>> author = box.unit(Author, Name='Sholem Aleichem')
>>> list(box.view((Authorship &lt;&lt; Book, [[], ['Title']],
                   lambda a, b: a.AuthorID == author.ID)))
[u"Yossele Solovey", u"Tevye's Daughters", u"Mottel the Cantor's son"]
</pre>
</p>


<a name='schemas'><h3>Managing Schemas</h3></a>

<h4>Conflicts</h4>

<p>Dejavu helps you make a <i>model</i> (in Python code) that matches some
<i>reality</i> (like an RDBMS, file, or cache) elsewhere. Because both the
model and reality can change independently, you'll find <i>conflicts</i>
between them from time to time. The most common occurrence of such conflicts
is during a call to <tt>map_all</tt>, since it tries to match up your entire
model to reality. Similar conflicts arise whenever you ask Dejavu to make
changes to reality: add an index, drop storage, or rename a property.</p>

<p>When conflicts may occur, Dejavu adds a <tt>conflicts</tt> argument to
the method arguments. The value you supply for this argument tells Dejavu
what to do if a conflict arises:</p>

    <ul>
    <li><b>error</b>: This is the default value. <tt>MappingError</tt> is
        raised for the first conflict and the call is aborted.</li>
    <li><b>warn</b>: StorageWarning is raised (instead of an error) for
        each issue, and the call is not aborted. This allows you to see all
        errors at once, without having to stop and fix each one and then
        execute the call again.</li>
    <li><b>repair</b>: Each issue will be resolved by changing the database
        to match the model. Not all calls support this mode for all errors;
        any which do not support this mode will error instead.</li>
    <li><b>ignore</b>: Any model conflicts are silently ignored. Use of this
        mode causes mandelbugs. You have been warned.</li>
    </ul>

<h4>Installation</h4>

<p>Since this procedure typically happens once per deployed application,
Dejavu doesn't try to over-engineer it. But the deployer will still have
to go through an installation step at some point. Dejavu offers minimal
library calls on top of which you can then build installation tools
(and upgrade, and uninstall tools).</p>

<p>For example, a simple install process could look like this:</p>

<pre>
elif cmd == "install":
    store.log = getlogger(os.path.join(os.getcwd(), localDir, "install.log"))
    store.logflags = logflags.ERROR + logflags.SQL + logflags.SANDBOX
    
    print "Creating databases...",
    store.create_database()
    print "ok"
    
    print "Creating tables...",
    store.map_all(conflicts='repair')
    print "ok"
    
    sys.exit(0)
</pre>

<p>In addition to <tt class='def'>create_database(conflicts='error')</tt>,
all Storage Managers also have
<tt class='def'>drop_database(conflicts='error')</tt> and
<tt class='def'>has_database()</tt> methods.</p>

<h4>Modifying Storage Structures</h4>

<p>The <tt>StorageManager</tt> class has some methods to help you make
changes to keep storage structures in sync with changes to your Unit
classes. For example, let's say that we deploy our
Archaeology-Biography application at various libraries around the world.
After a year, one of the developers wishes to implement a new reporting
feature; however, it would be easiest to build if the Unit Property names
could be exposed to the users. Unfortunately, our "ArchID" property on the
Biography class isn't very informative. It would be better if we could
rename that to "ArchaeologistID":</p>

<pre>
store.rename_property(Biography, "ArchID", "ArchaeologistID")
</pre>

<p>Assuming we've already made the change to our model, the above example
renames the property in the persistence layer (the database) using the
<tt class='def'>rename_property(cls, oldname, newname, conflicts='error')</tt>
method. Additional <tt>StorageManager</tt> methods:</p>

<p>Unit classes (tables):</p>
<ul>
<li><tt class='def'>create_storage(cls, conflicts='error')</tt></li>
<li><tt class='def'>has_storage(cls)</tt></li>
<li><tt class='def'>drop_storage(cls, conflicts='error')</tt></li>
</ul>

<p>Unit properties (columns):</p>
<ul>
<li><tt class='def'>add_property(cls, name, conflicts='error')</tt></li>
<li><tt class='def'>has_property(cls, name)</tt></li>
<li><tt class='def'>drop_property(cls, name, conflicts='error')</tt></li>
</ul>

<p>Unit property (column) indices:</p>
<ul>
<li><tt class='def'>add_index(cls, name, conflicts='error')</tt></li>
<li><tt class='def'>has_index(cls, name)</tt></li>
<li><tt class='def'>drop_index(cls, name, conflicts='error')</tt></li>
</ul>


<h4>Upgrading: Schema Objects</h4>

<p>The <tt>Schema</tt> class helps you manage changes to your Dejavu model
throughout its lifetime. Taking our <tt>rename_property</tt> example from
above, we can rewrite it in a Schema obejcts like this:</p>

<pre>class ArchBioSchema(dejavu.Schema):
    
    guid = 'da39a3ee5e6b4b0d3255bfef95601890afd80709'
    latest = 2
    
    def upgrade_to_2(self):
        self.store.rename_property(Biography, "ArchID", "ArchaeologistID")

abs = ArchBioSchema(store)
abs.upgrade()
</pre>

<p>The example declares this change to be "version 2" of our schema.
If you examine the base Schema class, you will see that it already has an
<tt>upgrade_to_0</tt> method. The "zeroth" upgrade makes no schema changes;
it merely marks all deployed databases with "version 0". I skipped version
1 in the example, just in case I need some setup code in the future ;).</p>

<p>If you call <tt class='def'>schema.upgrade(version)</tt> with a
version argument, then your deployment will be upgraded to that version.
If no argument is given, the installation will be upgraded to
<tt>schema.latest</tt>. You can even skip steps (i.e. remove methods
for broken steps) if it comes to that.</p>

<p>Each Schema also has a <tt class='def'>stage</tt> attribute.
While an upgrade is in process, this value will be an int, the same number
as that of the upgrade method. That is, while upgrade_to_2 is running,
<tt>stage</tt> will be 2. If no upgrade method is running, <tt>stage</tt>
will be None.</p>

<p>After you run <tt>upgrade</tt>, you can call the
<tt class='def'>assert_storage</tt> method of the Schema object
to tell Dejavu to create storage (tables in your database)
for all the Unit classes registered in your store.
If storage already exists for a given class, it is skipped.</p>

<p><b>Please note:</b> the installed version defaults to "latest". This
allows new installs to skip all the upgrade steps, and just use the latest
class definitions when they call <tt>assert_storage</tt>. However, it means
that if you deploy your apps for a while without a Schema, and then
introduce one later, you must manually decrement DeployedVersion from
"latest" to the actual deployed version *before* running your app for the
first time (or things will break due to the difference between the latest
and deployed schema).</p>


<h4>Versions: The DeployedVersion Unit</h4>

<p>The <tt>Schema</tt> class uses a magic table in the database to keep
track of each deployment's schema version. The Unit class is called
"DeployedVersion", and it has ID and Version attributes.</p>

<p>The ID attribute will be set to whatever your <tt>Schema.guid</tt>
is. It's a simple way to isolate multiple installed Dejavu applications.
A given application should use the same guid throughout its lifetime.
I used <tt>sha.new().hexdigest()</tt> to generate the example. Feel free
to use sha.new, a guid generator, a descriptive name, or whatever you
like.</p>


<a name='autoclass'><h3>Automatic Unit Classes</h3></a>

<p>When you create your first Dejavu model, you might be forming it
to match some existing database schema. If so, Dejavu has a
<tt>Modeler</tt> tool to help you inside <tt>dejavu.storage.db</tt>.
</p>

<p>The <tt class='def'>make_class(tablename, newclassname=None)</tt>
method finds an existing Table by name and returns a subclass
of Unit which models that table. By default, the new class
will have the same name as the database table; supply the
'newclassname' argument to use a different name (for example,
to capitalize the class name).</p>

<pre>
>>> from dejavu import storage
>>> from dejavu.storage import db
>>> sm = storage.resolve('mysql',
                         {"host": "localhost", "db": "existing_db",
                          "user": "root", "passwd": "xxxx",
                          })
>>> modeler = db.Modeler(sm.schema)
>>> Zoo = modeler.make_class("zoo", "Zoo")
>>> Zoo
&lt;class 'dejavu.storage.db.Zoo'>
>>> Zoo.properties
['id', 'name', 'admission', 'founded', 'lastescape', 'opens']
</pre>

<p>The <tt class='def'>make_source(tablename, newclassname=None)</tt>
method does the same thing as <tt>make_class</tt>, but returns a string
that contains valid Python code to generate the requested Unit class:</p>

<pre>
>>> print modeler.make_source("exhibit", "Exhibit")
class Exhibit(Unit):
    pettingallowed = UnitProperty(bool)
    animals = UnitProperty(str)
    name = UnitProperty(str)
    zooid = UnitProperty(int)
    acreage = UnitProperty(decimal.Decimal)
    creators = UnitProperty(str)
    # Remove the default 'ID' property.
    ID = None
    identifiers = ('name', 'zooid')
    sequencer = UnitSequencer()
</pre>

<p>Finally, you can perform this sort of modeling on <i>all</i> tables
in a database at once with the <tt class='def'>all_classes()</tt> and
<tt class='def'>all_source()</tt> methods of the Modeler. These simply
iterate over all of the known tables and return the results in a list
instead of a single value.</p>
